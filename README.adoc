This sample Laravel application is using Jibimo Laravel package available at https://github.com/J-TAG/jibimo-api-laravel-package to show you how to implement this package in your Laravel app.

== üéÅ Quick Start

This app will use Jibimo Laravel package which is implemented as separate commands in `app/Console/Commands` directory.

Simply install required packages using following composer command:

[source, bash]
----
composer install --prefer-stable
----

And then add Jibimo configs in your `.env` file:

[source, env]
----
JIBIMO_BASE_URL="https://jibimo.com/api"
JIBIMO_API_TOKEN="..." #Your Jibimo API token
----

Now you can use `Jibimo` static class available at `puresoft\jibimo\laravel` like `puresoft\jibimo\laravel\Jibimo::pay()`
or simply you can inject it to your method like this:

[source, php]
----
    public function myMethod(Jibimo $jibimo)
    {
        $response = $jibimo->pay(...);
        // ...
    }
----

Please take a look at commands that are available in `app/Console/Commands` to see examples of using this package.

=== üé© Installation in Your Own Laravel App

In order for adding Jibimo Laravel package to your own project you can run the following command in your own project root directory:

[source, bash]
----
composer require puresoft/jibimo-api-laravel --prefer-stable
----

Now you need to publish Jibimo configs using following command:

[source, bash]
----
php artisan vendor:publish --provider=puresoft\jibimo\laravel\JibimoServiceProvider
----

This will create a `jibimo.php` file in your config folder and now you can set environment variables in your `.env` file
as follow:

[source, env]
----
JIBIMO_BASE_URL="https://jibimo.com/api"
JIBIMO_API_TOKEN="..." #Your Jibimo API token
----

Please take a look at https://github.com/J-TAG/jibimo-api-laravel-package/blob/master/README.adoc for Jibimo Laravel package documentation.
